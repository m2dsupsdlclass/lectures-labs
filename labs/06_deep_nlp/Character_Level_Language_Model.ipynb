    "\n",
    "Building a language model is not very useful by it-self. However language models have recently been shown to be useful for **transfer learning** to build **contextualized word embeddings** as a better alternative to word2vec or GloVe.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The workflow is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **train a deep language model on a very large, unlabeled corpus** (e.g. 1 billion words or more);\n",
    "- plug the resulting **language model as the input layer** (and sometimes also the output layer) **of a task specific architecture**, for instance: text classification, semantic role labeling for knowledge extraction, logical entailment, question answering and reading comprehension;\n",
    "- **train the task specific parameters** of the new architecture on the **smaller task-labeled corpus**;\n",
    "- optionally fine-tune the full architecture on the task-labeled corpus if it's big enough not to overfit.\n",
