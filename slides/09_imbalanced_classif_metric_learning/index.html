## Classic Deep Learning data setup

- Classification with a single label per sample
- 2-1000 classes ; 1000+ samples per class

--

### Real life problems

What if I have multiple classes per sample?

--

What if I have unbalanced or noisy labels?

--

What if I have 1M classes and 10 samples / class?

???
class imbalance: frequent for fraud anomaly detectionxs

# Multi-labeling and Sampling strategies

---
## Dealing with Imbalance

Many real-life datasets are imbalanced, e.g. **anomaly detection**: (binary classification, most of the data is normal, very few points are anomalies)

--

The training process may fail if most batches have only a single class in them

You may use **oversampling**, **importance weighting** of minority classes / samples, to help the optimization process. In Keras:

--

```python
# build your own batches and add weights
model.train_on_batch(self, x, y, class_weight=None, sample_weight=None)
``` 
--

Evaluation must be very rigorous (the test set should represent the **true distribution** of data and labels)

???

Binary imbalance, try to build batches with 1/3 of the minority class and 2/3 majority
---
## Multilabel classification

Build a **binary classifier for each class** but with shared
activations on hidden layers. Easily adapted from classic classification:

```python
# ...
x = Convolution2D(2048, 3)(x)
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1000, activation="softmax")(x)
```

???
Know any system we already talked about which is multilabel?
_Object detection such as Fast RCNN is multilabel!_

---
## Multilabel classification 

Build a **binary classifier for each class** but with shared
activations on hidden layers. Easily adapted from classic classification:

```python
# ...
x = Convolution2D(2048, 3)(x)
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1000, activation="sigmoid")(x)
```
Replace `softmax` with `sigmoid` (output activation)

Replace `categorical_crossentropy` with `binary_crossentropy` (loss)

--

$y^{true}$ is a binary vector corresponding to classes present in the image (many-hot encoding).

--

**Problem** : costly to label images exhaustively for ALL possible tags

- Facebook trained a ResNet on Instagram's hashtags
- Very noisy labels, most don't represent the image content

--
- The model fine-tuned on ImageNet reached the best accuracy

---

## Inference tricks

You may train with a **softmax**, and do multilabel inference with a **sigmoid**

.footnote.small[
Garrigues, P., Farfade, S., Izadinia, H., Boakye, K., & Kalantidis, Y. (2016). Tag prediction at flickr: a view from the darkroom. NIPS workshop on large scale CV 2016
]

--

Fine tune the **output bias** parameter on a small by **fully labeled** dataset

Score reflects the posterior of a tag being present in an image, e.g.  $p(dog|image)$

--

Measure **precision/recall** per class on a fully labeled test set.

???
output score is **Interpretable**: it should
**Consistent across tags:** a score of 0.8 for “cat” classifier ~ same meaning as score of 0.8 for the “flower” classifier (while no guarantee)

Impossible to measure a correct precision / recall on the weak dataset
This is what we use at Heuritech for multilabeling

# Metric Learning & Siamese networks

## Few Examples per class

ex: Face Recognition/Verification

--

.center[
          <img src="images/lfw.png" style="width: 500px;" />
]

- **Recognition:** given a face, classify among K possible persons
- **Verification:** verify that two faces belongs to the same person

--

A verification system can be implemented as a similarity measure. If it's really good, useful for recognition.

???

- **Recognition:** multi-class classification. Model cannot predict identities
unseen in the training set.

- **Verification:** binary classification on pairs of faces. Can
generalize to identities unseen in the training set. Not necessary to
retrain the full model to handle new identities.

## Learning a distance function


We want to build $d_{\theta}( x_1, x_2 )$ which indicates degree of difference between images

--

We define a threshold $T$ such that if $d_{\theta}( x_1, x_2 ) < T$, we consider $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be of the same class (e.g. identity)

--

**Not a real distance** (no guarantee for triangle inequality)

--

<br/>

**Mahalanobis distance Metric Learning** may be used to build distances, but are limited to linear projections, which won't be enough for fine-grained image analysis

.footnote.small[
Weinberger, Kilian Q., John Blitzer, and Lawrence K. Saul. "Distance metric learning for large margin nearest neighbor classification." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2006.
]
???
not a real distance, but we just want a semantic proxy of a distance

---
## Learning a distance function

$$
d\_{\theta}( x\_1, x\_2 ) = || f\_{\theta}(x\_1) - f\_{\theta}(x\_2) ||\_2
$$

--

$f_{\theta}$ is typically a CNN which outputs a fixed dense  $\mathbb{R}^d$ representation of the image.

$f_{\theta}$ maps image space to an **isometric representation space** where a simple metric (e.g.
euclidean distance) represents **semantic distance**.

--

For other problems (sound, NLP), different networks may be used (CNN with 1D convolutions, RNNs, ...) which
output a fixed dimension vector representing each input element.

--

Training $f_{\theta}$ is also called **representation learning**

???
Euclidean distance directly in the space of pixels is not a good proxy: very dependant for instance of lighting conditions or pose

---
## Siamese networks

.center[
          <img src="images/siamese.svg" style="width: 500px;" />
]

.footnote.small[
Chopra, Sumit, Raia Hadsell, and Yann LeCun. "Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification." CVPR 2005.
]

???
Build a loss function, and propagate to the two branches. Updated with the sum of gradients from the two branches
---
## Loss function

.center[
          <img src="images/contrastive.png" style="width: 300px;" />
]

**Contrastive loss:** Pushes together same class pairs, and further away different class ones, up to a margin.

$L_\text{contrastive}(Y, D) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - Y)D^2 + \frac{1}{2}Y\max(0, m - D)^2$

.footnote.small[
Chopra, Sumit, Raia Hadsell, and Yann LeCun. "Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification." CVPR 2005.
]

---
## Alternative loss functions

Can derive equivalent contrastive loss for cosine similarity:


$$cosine(f\_{\theta}(x\_1), f\_{\theta}(x\_2))$$

--

Alternatively, **absolute difference + Binary classification**:

$$y = sigmoid ( \mathbf{w} \cdot |f\_{\theta}(x\_1) - f\_{\theta}(x\_2)| + b)$$

???
difference is a vector
--

Also, **concat + Binary classification**

$$y = sigmoid ( \mathbf{w} \cdot f\_{\theta}(x\_1) ||  f\_{\theta}(x\_2) + b)$$


--

<br/>

Simpler:regression after cosine similarity

---
## Training

- sample positive pairs $(x_i, x_j)$, with $(i, j)$ of same class
- sample negative pairs $(x_i, x_j)$, with $(i, j)$ of different classes

.footnote.small[
Taigman et. al., 2014. DeepFace closing the gap to human level performance
]

--


Forward pass using both inputs through the two networks (**same parameters**, **different activations**)

--

Backpropagate through the two networks (the weights are updated with the **sum of the two gradients**)

--

Important to **craft batches carefully** (balance positive and negative, group positives together).
Many negatives are *easy* (closer than margin) & don't contribute to the loss.

???
better to group pairs rather than pick random positive and negatives
Can be tricky to train, sensible on input
---
## Dataset Face verification

# Triplet Loss

---
## Triplet Loss

A triplet: $(x^a, x^{+}, x^{-})$
- an anchor image
- a positive image (same person as anchor)
- a negative image (different person as anchor)

We compute $f_{\theta}$ for each of these 3 images

--

We want that:

$||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2 \geq ||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2$

--

$||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2 - ||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 \geq \alpha$

$\alpha$ **margin** typically small positive number $(0.2, 0.5, \cdot)$

--

**minimize** $||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 - ||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2 + \alpha $

???

Although we did not a do direct comparison to other
losses, e.g. the one using pairs of positives and negatives, as
used in [14] Eq. (2), we believe that the triplet loss is more
suitable for face verification. The motivation is that the loss
from [14] encourages all faces of one identity to be projected
Z onto a single point in the embedding space. The
triplet loss, however, tries to enforce a margin between each
pair of faces from one person to all other faces. This allows
the faces for one identity to live on a manifold, while
still enforcing the distance and thus discriminability to other
identities.

---
##Triplet Loss

$l(x^a, x^{+}, x^{-}) =$

$max(||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 -
                           ||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2 + \alpha, 0)$

.footnote.small[
Schroff et al.,2015, FaceNet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering
]

--

**Training**

- Sample a minibatch of triplets $\\{(x^a, x^{+}, x^{-})_i\\}$
- Forward pass on all 3 networks using $f_{\theta}$
- Compute $\sum\_i l((x^a, x^{+}, x^{-})\_i)$

--
- Compute the gradients through the 3 networks
- update $f_{\theta}$ using the sum of 3 gradients

???
Also, L2 normalization of embeddings

---
## Hard negative sampling

After a few epochs, If $(x^a, x^{+}, x^{-})$ are chosen randomly, it will be easy to satisfy the inequality.

--

Gradient in one batch quickly become almost $0$ except for **hard cases**.
Random sampling is inefficient to find these hard cases

--

- **Hard triplet sampling:** sample $x^{-}$ such that:

$||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 > ||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2 + \alpha$

- **Semi Hard triplet sampling:** sample $x^{-}$ such that:

$||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 > ||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2$

---
## Hard negative sampling

$||f(x^a) - f(x^{+})||_2 > ||f(x^a) - f(x^{-})||_2$

---
## Getting started

Available open source implementations / pretrained models:
- Openface https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/
- FaceNet https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet
- DeepFace

Commercial recognition systems are trained on a large datasets like 10/100 million images

--

**Deploying Verification models** e.g. Iphone FaceID: 

Beforehand, precompute representations of your 10 photos

--

At test time, compute representation of the photo, then compute similarities with the 10 representations

If a similarity is within a predefined threshold then Unlock!

---
## Take Aways on classification

- For most cases, use a **classifier with softmax**
- If you have many classes, and/or strong class imbalance use **representation learning**
- both can give useful embeddings for clustering / low shot learning
 
--
 

- Use **ImageNet pre-trained features** in most cases
- Ongoing research on learning *weakly* supervised features: cover larger spectrum of image domains

--

Use of **simulations** for generating data esp localisation / segmentation data (GTA V...)
