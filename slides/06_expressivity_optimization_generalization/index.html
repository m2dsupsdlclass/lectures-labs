# Decomposition of the Error

**Approximation error**:
- decreases when $\mathcal{F}$ increases;
- but typically bounded by computational constraints.

--

**Estimation error**:
- decreases when $n$ increases;
- can increase when $\mathcal{F}$ increases (according to VC theory).

--

**Optimization error**:
- can increase when tolerance $\rho$ increases;
- can increase when $\mathcal{F}$ gets more complex (non-convex obj.).

Examples of computational constraints: training time, size of the model
parameters and activations in GPU RAM or mobile phone RAM, prediction
latency...

**Question** how do rho, n and F impact the compute time?

# Expressivity and Universal Function Approximation

## Universal Function Approximation

Let $\sigma$ be a nonconstant, bounded, and monotonically-increasing
continuous function. For any $f \in C([0, 1]^{d})$ and $\varepsilon >
0$, there exists $h \in \mathbb{N}$ real constants $v\_i, b\_i \in
\mathbb{R}$ and real vectors $w_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that:

$$ | \sum\_i^h v\_i \sigma(w\_i^Tx + b\_i) - f (x) | < \varepsilon  $$

that is: neural nets are dense in $C([0, 1]^{d})$.

This still holds for any compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and if
$\sigma$ is the ReLU function (Sonoda &amp; Murata, 2015).

# Problem solved?

UFA theorems **do not tell us**:

- The number $h$ of hidden units is small enough to have the network fit
  in RAM.

- The optimal function parameters can be found in finite time by
  minimizing the Empirical Risk with SGD and the usual random
  initialization schemes.

???
A finite smple version of the theorem is constructive enough to fit a
MLP with $2n + d$ parameters where $n$ is the number of points in the
dataset. That requires running a $n$ by $n$ system though.

**Question**: why would it be a bad idea to deterministically set the
weights of a single the network to carve tiny n-dimensional rectangular
boxes around each sample in the training set?

**Question**: how many parameters would it be required to naively carve
rectangular boxes around each training sample in MNIST?

**Question**: Assume that instead of hard / vertical recangular boxes we
used a smoother slope to carve the boxes around the samples. How would
that relate to kernelized logistic / ridge regression? How such a
network would differ from a fixed kernel machine?

Adding the parameters required for **one new layer** can **multiply by
two the number of local oscillations** in the decision function of the
model.

This is to be constrasted with the approach of adding parameters
**on the same layer** (as in the rectangle example) that can only
contribute an **additive number of new local oscillations**.

---
# Depth and Parametric Cost

[Matus Telgarsky, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04485): There exists
functions that can be approximated by a deep ReLU network with
$\Theta(k^3)$ layers with a $\Theta(1)$ units that cannot be
approximated by shallower networks with $\Theta(k)$ layers unless they
have $\Omega(2^k)$ units.

Note: the number of parameters of a deep network is typically quadratic
with the number of units.

???

This also **holds for ReLU convnets with max pooling layers** and
polynomial architectures.

# Conditioning Issues

Vanishing gradients:

- Deep FF Network: smaller gradient components in first layers;
- Vanilla RNN with many time steps.

--

Text model with word embeddings as input:

 - Some words are much less frequent than others;
 - Rare non-zero gradient for matching columns in embedding.

--

Optimal learning rate should be higher for some gradient components:

  - Bad conditioning of the Hessian matrix.

---
# Fixing Conditioning Issues

Fixing the optimizer:

 - AdaGrad, RMSProp, AdaDelta, ADAM
 - Cheap rescaling of the gradient components by the square root of the
   (moving) average of $g_i^2$

--

Fixing the architecture:

  - Skip, Residual connections (e.g. ResNets) and HighWay networks;
  - LSTM and GRU with additive lanes from activations $h_{t-1}$ to $h_t$;
  - Normalization layers.

???
ADAM and co cannot fix curvature issues in directions that are not
aligned with parameter axis: diagonal preconditioner.

More advanced second-order optimizers are often too costly (per-step)
to be able to be used on large neural networks.

# Batch Normalization

---
# Batch Normalization

At **inference time**, use average and standard deviation computed on
**the whole dataset** instead of batch

--

Widely used in **ConvNets**, but requires the mini-batch to be large
enough to compute statistics in the minibatch.

--

In **Keras**: use it as a layer, before activation	
	
```python
x = Convolution2D(64, 1, 1)(input_tensor)
x = BatchNormalization()(x)
x = Activation('relu')(x)
```

--

- Introduces new parameters: `2 x size_of_activation` (here 128)

--
- Keras keeps track of a **running average/std** of activations for
  inference, no need to have specific inference code.

--

Much less effective in RNNs (but variants exist)

---
# Layer Normalizations

Normalize on the statistics of the **layer activations** instead of
mini-batch.

# Weight Normalization

Reparametrize weights of neurons, to decouple **direction** and **norm**
of the weight:

$$
\mathbf{w}  = \frac{g}{||\mathbf{v}||}\mathbf{v}

.footnote.small[

reparameterization to accelerate training of deep neural networks." NIPS

One new parameter $g$ to learn per neuron

--

Careful **data-based** initialization of $g$ and neuron bias $b$ is
better (not applicable to RNNs)

--
- Layer Norm strongly impacts LSTM in language modelling tasks

--

Active area of research - See "Normalizing the Normalizers"

---
# BTW: why minibatch SGD?

High capacity Deep Networks require a **large number of training
samples** (typically at least 10,000).

--

Samples contribute **redundant gradient information**. Otherwise
generalization would not be possible and no learning would ever happen.

--

SGD is more computationally efficient when dealing with redundant
samples:
- many updates per-epoch for SGD, one for full-batch GD
- doubling the size of the training with copies of samples would double
  the training time with full-batch GD
- no impact on training time of SGD.

???
Note: small batch SGD also has good generalization characteristics, see:
Bottou and Bousquet, 2008 for the convex case and the next slides for
the DL case.

Using L2 penalty on weights rarely helps.

Reducing width can cause optimization issues.

Early stopping mostly avoids wasting compute optimizing for nothing.

Data augmentation and stochastic regularization (dropout) often help
but:
  - it also makes training (much) slower,
  - too much gradient variance can prevent training completely.

Ensembling models can help and can be reasonably cheap with SGD
restarts ("snapshot ensembles").

# Conclusion

# Conclusion

A strong optimizer is not necessarily a strong learner.

DL optimization is non-convex but bad local minima and saddle
structures are rarely a problem (on common DL tasks).

Neural Networks are over-parametrized but can still generalize.

Stochastic Gradient is a strong implicit regularizer.

Variance in gradient can help with generalization but can hurt final
convergence.

We need more theory to guide the design of architectures and
optimizers that make **learning** faster with fewer labels.

---
# Practical Takeaways

Overparametrize deep architectures

Design architectures to limit conditioning issues:
  - Use skip / residual connections
  - Internal normalization layers

Use stochastic optimizers that are robust to bad conditioning

Use small minibatches (at least at the beginning of optimization)

Use validation set to anneal learning rate and do early stopping

Is it very often possible to trade more compute for less overfitting
with **data augmentation** and **stochastic regularizers** (e.g.
dropout).

Collecting **more labelled data** is the best way to avoid overfitting.
